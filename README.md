# PyRPG
A simple and complex game on Python that i and my friend made on school(basicly i did but he helped hehe). Open to anyone who wanna help improve the code. Please coment any suggestions and bugs so i can learn and improve the game.

## Instalation
Install the requiered libraries. (i think that requieriments are well made but if it doesn't install then u will have to install all the libraries by hand, theres only 5)
``` pip install requieriments.txt
