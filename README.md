# PyRPG
A simple and complex game on Python that i and my friend made on school(basicly i did but he helped hehe). Open to anyone who wanna help improve the code. Please coment any suggestions and bugs so i can learn and improve the game.
------
This game is an upgrade of the game that i made (https://github.com/SoyNashi/kill-the-boss).
I improved some graphic and design of the game: Colours, textart, unicode charecters (It doesnt work well on linux because the uniode charecters work diferent or idk but it doesnt show the charecters. Some of them). 
Also i simplified the game by making all in one page. By the moment idk how to combine two diferent codes to work thogether but i think that if that is possible it woud work better if i had to improve the game.
I used python because its more simple and i can use libraries.
The structure of the code is a bit messy but i made all by functions so i can go back and foward in the game more easy. Some variables are copies of other because it didnt work fine or idk but in that way it worked so i won't touch it.
## HE GAME IS IN SPANISH, IM WORKING ON A TRADUCTION TO ENGLISH.

## Instalation
Install the requiered libraries. (i think that requieriments are well made but if it doesn't install then u will have to install all the libraries by hand, theres only 5)
``` pip install requieriments.txt
