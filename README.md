# PyRPG
A simple and complex game on Python that i and my friend made on school(basicly i did but he helped hehe). Open to anyone who wanna help improve the code. Please coment any suggestions and bugs so i can learn and improve the game.

## Learning 
This game is an upgrade of the game that i made (https://github.com/SoyNashi/kill-the-boss).
I improved some graphic and design of the game: Colours, textart, unicode charecters (It doesnt work well on linux because the uniode charecters work diferent or idk but it doesnt show the charecters. Some of them). 
Also i simplified the game by making all in one page. By the moment idk how to combine two diferent codes to work thogether but i think that if that is possible it woud work better if i had to improve the game.
I used python because its more simple and i can use libraries.
The structure of the code is a bit messy but i made all by functions so i can go back and foward in the game more easy. Some variables are copies of other because it didnt work fine or idk but in that way it worked so i won't touch it.
U can make branches but i would prefer that u just comment wat i can improve so i learn.

## HE GAME IS IN SPANISH, IM WORKING ON A TRADUCTION TO ENGLISH.
But it will take me some time because the variables are in spanish and catalan and I would have to change everything. The spanish version i would leave it as is and i will improve the english version. 
But downt worry because the spanish version has no bugs (or not that i see, maybe 5 or 6 but not in the game).

## Instalation
Install the requiered libraries. (i think that requieriments are well made but if it doesn't install then u will have to install all the libraries by hand, theres only 5)
``` pip install requieriments.txt ``` 

# To Do
Heres a list of what things i have to make.
- translate to english.
  - Translate all variables
  - maybe make a code that grabs text from another file and in that way i can make that the game in more languages.
    - Make the code
    - make a switch option in the menu
    - export all texts into files in the correct folder
    - translate the files
- Clean the code, make it more easy to see.
- Publish this repository somwere so someone can see it and hopefly help me.
